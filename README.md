BEng Final Year Design Project: Portable Braai with Water Heater.

To the average South African, participating in recreational outdoor camping is the norm rather than the exception, and in this modern world having the ‘luxury’ of a hot shower during such activities would be beneficial to their overall experience. This study thus aims to bridge the gap between the outdoor life and modernity of the 21st Century by designing a system that accommodates the heating and consequent use of water in a camp-like setting.

Consequently a portable Braaiing Apparatus was deigned (from the inlet to outlet) by which the excess heat from said braai would heat the water for a comfortable shower. The concept selected for the Braaiing Apparatus was simplistic in nature, where heat transfer, fluid flow, and ergonomic aspects were considered to be of most significance. Being such, the design fulfilled all user requirements that had been specified.
